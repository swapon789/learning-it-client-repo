                    <p>In fact, professionals learn in all these ways, and trainers should not overlook the varieties of
                            opportunities to learn. Learning solutions is a term we use to describe the modes of training
                            delivery available to us (e.g., online learning or classroom) and the environments we create that
                            provide opportunities to learn (e.g., a course, self-directed study, on-the-job mentoring or
                            coaching). Choosing a learning solution requires that we consider logistical constraints,
                            pedagogical needs, and audience requirements.
                            While that sounds complicated (and at times it can be complicated), it is not that different from
                            other decisions we make in our daily lives. For example, imagine making a decision about a “place
                            to live.” Now, we could have said “finding a house,” but that pre-supposes that I want a house and
                            that a house is the only type of living situation that will suffice. But maybe I would benefit more
                            from something that is not a house – an apartment, for example, or a mobile home, or maybe even
                            a boat. My circumstances and preferences will play a big part in my choice.
                            In making the core choice of the type of structure to live in I will need to consider many criteria,
                            such as my budget, how long I plan to live in the area, whether I live alone or with my family, which
                            possessions I need with me, how much time I have to maintain the living place, the options
                            available to me, etc. All of these will then contribute to my decisions about cost, renting versus
                            buying, size of living space, numbers of bedrooms, location, etc. It is usually only later, when I
                            have narrowed it down to one or two solutions, that I will begin to choose between the details like
                            style and furnishings and how I might organize my possessions there. You can see how the
                            decision is multi-faceted, and while a logical process to the decision is useful, flexibility is also
                            required. What is most important is not to jump to a single conclusion without consider a variety of
                            criteria and a variety of options that might meet them.
